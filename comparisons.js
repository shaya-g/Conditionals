// -------------------
// PART 1: Comparing variables
// -------------------

var numberTeachers = 4
var numberStudents = 20
var stringTeachers = "4"
var numberDogs = 0

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?", numberTeachers > numberStudents);
// this should log: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log("Is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?", numberTeachers < numberStudents);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?
// this should log: false
console.log("Is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers", numberTeachers === stringTeachers)
// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?
// this should log: true
console.log("is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?", numberTeachers !== numberStudents)

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true
console.log("is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?", numberStudents >= 20)
// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?
// this should log: false
console.log("is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?", numberStudents >= 21)
// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true
console.log("is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?", numberStudents <= 20)
// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?
// this should log: true
console.log("is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?", numberStudents <= 21)

// #-------------------
// PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
// #-------------------

// For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a Comment,
// in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.
// Be as technically precise as possible, but don't just copy and paste a definition from the readings.
// Make sure YOU can explain it that way!

console.log(4 < 9);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// The line of code is printing out the comparison.  The word "true" will be printed because it is evaluating if 4 is less than 9.
var books = 3;
console.log(4 < books);
// YOU DO: Explain.
//The variable books is made to equal 3. The next line of code will evaluate if the comparison of 4 < 3 is true or false. "False" will be printed.
var friends = 6;
var siblings = 2;
console.log(friends > siblings);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// The variable friend is established to equal 6. Siblings is 2. The last line of code is evaluating if friends (6) will be less than siblings (2). "False" will be printed.
var attendees = 9;
var meals = 8;
console.log(attendees != meals);
// YOU DO: Explain.
// The variable attendees is equal to 9. Meals is 8. The last line is evaluating to see if the variable attendees (9) is not equal to that of the variable meals (8). "True" will be printed.

// #-------------------
// PART 3: Logical Operators
// #-------------------

var isHungry = true;
var finishedHomework = false;

// EXAMPLE:
// Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry && finishedHomework);
// Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry || finishedHomework);

var lovesToPlay = true;
var lovesDogPark = false;
var lovesTreats = true;
var age = 1;

// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesTreats);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay || lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
console.log(lovesToPlay && age);
// What did your final line of code evaluate to? Why do you think that is? Explain.
// ANSWER: It evaluated to 1. I believe this occurred because lovesToPlay is a boolean, wheras age is a number.
